# Handling Missing Data

This project aims to learn how to detect and handle missing data in datasets.

## Requirements

To run this project, follow the steps below.

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Alex0711/handling-missing-data.git
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment with Conda

Create a virtual environment with Conda to install the required dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 3. Data files

The project works with 5 data files. Here's how to obtain each one:

1. **`missing_data_encoding_example.csv`**: This file is already included in the repository, in the `data/raw/` folder.
2. **Other files**: Four additional files are required:
   - One must be downloaded manually from the following link and saved in the `data/raw/` folder: [Download `pima-indians-diabetes.csv`](https://deepnote.com/workspace/platzi-escuela-datos-83832097-f136-43ff-b38d-abaa022e8ec7/project/datos-faltantes-694a3d08-7f18-421d-9e2f-c2820a79680e/data/pima-indians-diabetes.csv)
   - The other three files are downloaded and created by one of the notebooks.

### 4. Run the Notebooks

Once you've set up the environment and the data files, open and run the notebooks to explore handling missing data. All notebooks work using the mentioned files.
